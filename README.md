# Tornado-Visualization
A Tableau visualization that depicts location and storm intensity data points collected from NOAA Storm Prediction Center. The original dataset consisted of three million rows that were mined to less than a million rows to accommodate our project goals. Currently, predictive software for storms have limitations in that 1) A lack of the ability to show storm data over time in a single visual and 2) A lack of mechanisms to allow zooming in on a single storm without losing scope. Using this visualization, users without deep knowledge of storm tracking or GIS software and background can explore the data set and use the information displayed on all geographic zoom levels
